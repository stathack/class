# Course Project

## Overview

The final project is an opportunity to apply what you learn in this course to a problem of your choosing. Not only is the final project an interesting learning opportunity, it will also become a valuable part of your data science portfolio. Real code applied to a real problem and available on Github is more powerful for many employers than any bullet points on a written resume.

Note also that completion of a final project, including presenting it to the class, is a requirement for a Certificate of Completion for the course.


## Project Deliverables

You are responsible for creating a **project paper** and a **project presentation**. The paper should be written with a technical audience in mind, while the presentation should target a more general audience. You will deliver your presentation (including slides) during the final week of class, on Nov 10 and Nov 12.

Your **paper** should cover the following:

* Problem statement and hypothesis
* Description of your data set and how it was obtained
* Description of any pre-processing / data-munging steps
* What you learned from exploring the data, including visualizations
* How you chose which features to use in your analysis
* Details of your modeling process, including how you selected your models and validated them
* Your challenges and successes
* Possible extensions or business applications of your project
* Conclusions and key learnings

Your **presentation** should cover these components with less breadth and less depth. Focus on creating an engaging, clear, and informative presentation that tells the story of your project.

Optional- Create a GitHub repository for your project under you user id.

Either submit the github repo or submit in the Drive folder the following:

* **Project paper:** any format (iPython Notebook, PDF, Markdown, etc.)
* **Presentation slides:** any format (PDF, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.)
* **Code:** commented Python code and any other code you used in the project
* **Data:** data files (see below for more info)
* **Data dictionary:** description of each variable, including units

If it's not possible or practical to include your entire dataset, you should link to your data source and provide a sample of the data. (GitHub has a [size limit](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/) of 100 MB per file and 1 GB per repository.) If your data is private, you can either include an "anonymized" version of your data or create a private GitHub repository.


Tips for success:
* The work should stand "on its own", and should not depend upon the reader remembering anything you might have previously said in class about your project.
* Organize your narrative and files so that the reader can easily follow along.
* The better you explain your project, and the easier it is to follow, the more useful feedback you will receive!
* If your reviewers can actually run your code on the provided data, they will be able to give you more useful feedback on your code. (It can be very hard to make useful code suggestions on code that can't be run!)


### June 6: Presentation

Deliver your project presentation in class and submit all required deliverables (paper, slides, code, data, and data dictionary).
